         <td>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, 
           resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
            It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers
                          
            </td>
                
          
            <td>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and 
            allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions you define. 
            You can use the fleet management features of EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain the health and
             availability of your fleet.
                       
            </td>
            <td>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry 
            that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. .</td>
            <td> Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use 
           with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability
            Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. 
          
            </td>
            <td>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable,
             high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines,
             or schedule containers on those virtual machines.
            </td>
            <td>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) makes it easy to deploy, manage,
             and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.
            </td>
            <td> Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers you everything needed to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. Whether you’re new to the cloud or looking to get on the cloud quickly with AWS infrastructure you trust,
             we’ve got you covered.
            </td>
            <td>AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized instances)
             based on the volume and pecific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. </td>
            <td>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and 
            scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js,
             Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.</td>

            <td>AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers 
            without having to manage servers or clusters. </td>
            <td>AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.</td>
            <td>Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.</td>
            <td>VMware Cloud on AWS is an integrated cloud offering jointly developed by AWS and VMware delivering a highly scalable, secure and innovative service that allows organizations to seamlessly migrate and extend their on-premises VMware vSphere-based environments to the AWS Cloud running on next-generation Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
             bare metal infrastructure.
